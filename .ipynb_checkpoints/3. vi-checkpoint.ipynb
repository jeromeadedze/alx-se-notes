    "## Vim\n",
    "### What is vi/vim\n",
    "Vi/Vim is a text editor that can be used in the command line.\n",
    "What makes this text editor very popular amongst developers is because when software developers/engineers work on servers, they often only have access to command-line editors, and in the command line, most 3rd party code editors like Atom, VS Code, etc. won't work. This is where terminal-based editors like vi/vim, Emacs, Less, Nano, etc. come into play. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is called ***vi*** (***Vi***sual Editor) or ***vim*** (***V***i ***IM***proved). Originally, it was developed to work on UNIX-based operating systems, but as of now, it can also be installed as a standalone application on Windows Operating System.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modes of operation:\n",
    "Vim has two \"modes\": ***COMMAND mode and INSERT mode***. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In COMMAND mode, you execute commands (like undo, redo, find and replace, quit, etc.). \n",
    "- In INSERT mode, you type text. This makes it versatile and efficient for developers/engineers to write code and scripts. \n",
    "- There is a third mode, ***VISUAL mode*** that is used to highlight and edit text in bulk.\n",

    "### To Start vi\n",
    "\n",
    "To use ***vi on a file***, type in `vi filename`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the file named filename exists, then the first page (or screen) of the file will be displayed; if the file does not exist, then an empty file and screen are created into which you may enter text.\n",

    "### To Exit vi\n",
    "To leave vi \n",

    "## Basic Commands:\n",
    "In the vi editor the mouse does not control the movement of the cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must therefore use the the key commands listed below to control the cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "On some UNIX platforms, the arrow keys may be used as well; However, since vi was designed with the Qwerty keyboard (containing no arrow keys) in mind, the arrow keys sometimes produce strange effects in vi and should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go back and forth between a PC environment(Windows Os) and a UNIX environment(Mac Os), you may find dissimilarities in methods for cursor movement and this can be frustrating.\n",

    "- `v` : gets you to visual mode\n",

    "### Searching for a word \n",
    "1. In normal mode, you can search ***forward or backward***.\n",
    "2. One can search forward in vim/vi by pressing `/` and then typing your search pattern/word.\n",
    "3. To search backward in vi/vim by press `?` and then typing your search pattern/word.\n",
    "4. Once word found in vim, you can press the `n` key to go directly to the next occurrence of the word. Press the `N` key to go directly to the opposite direction.\n",

    "#### \"Recording @q\" message at the bottom of your Vim terminal\n",
    "In Vim, a macro is a way to record a sequence of keystrokes and save it for later playback. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks by replaying the recorded macro instead of manually typing the same commands or keystrokes multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To initiate the recording of a macro in Vim, you typically follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Press the `q` key, followed by a letter to specify the register where you want to save the macro. For example, to save the macro in register `q`, you would press `qq`. The letter can be any lowercase letter from `a` to `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Vim will then start recording your keystrokes until you tell it to stop. You can now perform a series of commands, movements, or text edits that you want to include in the macro.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once you're done recording the macro, press the `q` key again to stop recording. The message \"Recording @<letter>\" will disappear from the bottom of the Vim terminal, indicating that the macro has been successfully recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "After recording a macro, you can replay it by typing `@<letter>`, where `<letter>` is the register where the macro was saved. For example, if you recorded the macro in register `q`, you would type `@q` to replay it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macros are particularly useful for tasks that involve repetitive edits or commands. By recording a macro once, you can easily repeat the same sequence of actions on different parts of your file without having to manually perform each step.\n",
