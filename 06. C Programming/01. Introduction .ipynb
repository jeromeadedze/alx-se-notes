To understand this better, take the example of following through a recipe and preparing a dish. In that case, mixing all the ingredients and preparing the dish is ***processing***, whereas collecting all the ingredients in the right amount, performing all the pre-preparatory steps come under ***preprocessing***.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before the actual compilation of every C program it is passed through a ***Preprocessor***. \n",
    "- The ***Preprocessor*** is a part of the compiler which performs preliminary operations (conditionally compiling code, including files etc...) to your code before the compiler sees it.\n",
    "    - Think of the preprocessor as a helper that performs some initial modifications to your code before the actual compilation by the compiler.\n",
    "- The ***Preprocessor*** looks through the program trying to find out specific instructions called ***Preprocessor directives*** that it can understand. All Preprocessor directives begin with the `#` (hash) symbol. \n",

    "### Directives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directives are special instructions directed to the ***preprocessor*** on how it should process your source code.\n",

    "- When you include a header file in your C program using the `#include` directive, the contents of the header file are effectively copied and pasted into your program before compilation. This allows your program to access the declarations and definitions contained in the header file.\n",

    "\n",
    "NB : In C the `main()` function can be left without adding a return value. By default, it will return zero/one depending on the program's exit status. ( ***meaning if you omit the return statement in the `main()` function, the compiler automatically adds a return 0; statement at the end, indicating a successful program termination. However, it is considered good practice to explicitly include a return statement to make the intent clear*** )\n",

    "## The `exit( )` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a C library function, `exit()`, that can be used to end a program. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this phase, pre-processing of the source file is done. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pre-processor is a program that accepts the C source code file and then it performs the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It will remove the comments from the source code.\n",
    "- It will perform the ***expansion*** of the included header files. ( This is the addition of another file containing some pre-written code into our C Program. It is accomplished through the use of the `#include` directive. During pre-processing, file inclusion adds the whole contents of the filename to the source code, replacing the `#include filename` directive and producing a new intermediate file. )\n",
    "\n",
    "***The main purpose of preprocessing is to prepare the source code for compilation.***\n",

    "\n",
    "The expanded code from the preprocessor is then passed on to the ***compiler***.\n",

    "A ***compiler*** is a program that ***converts the high-level language code to the assembly code***, which is then converted into the machine code, that the machine can understand.\n",

    "\n",
    "> The source file which got the (`.i`) extension in the previous step gets converted into (`.s`) extension by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3: Assembling\n",
    "\n",
    "An ***assembler*** is used to translate assembly-level code (.s files) into machine-readable code (in binary/hexadecimal format).\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting file is known as an object file/code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The extension of the file in this step becomes (`.obj`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: Linking\n",
    "\n",
    "Linking is the process of integrating library files into our program. Library files are prepackaged files that contain the definition of functions in machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object (`.o/.obj`) file contains some unknown statements and functions that our operating system cannot interpret. You can think of this as a book with some unfamiliar terms in it, and you’ll use a dictionary to figure out what they mean. Similarly, we use Library Files to provide explanations for some unknown statements in our object file.\n",
