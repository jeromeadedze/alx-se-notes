    "## Structure of a C Program\n",
    "\n",
    "As a building is made of bricks, a C program is made of basic elements, such as expressions, statements, statement blocks, and function blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by learning two smaller but important elements, ***constant and variable***, which make up expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name implies, a ***constant*** is a value that never changes.\n",
    "A ***variable***, on the other hand, can be used to present different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`i = 1;`\n",
    "\n",
    "where the symbol 1 is a constant because it always has the same value (1), and the symbol `i` is assigned the constant `1`. In other words, `i` contains the value of `1` after the statement is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, if there is another statement,\n",
    "\n",
    "`i = 10;`\n",
    "after it is executed, `i` is assigned the value of `10`. \n",
    "Because i can contain different values, it’s called a ***variable*** in the C language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of constants, variables, and operators that are used to denote computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(2 + 3) * 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "is an expression that adds 2 and 3 first, and then multiplies the result of the addition by 10. (The final result of the expression is 50.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other examples of expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `6` : An expression of a constant.\n",
    "- `i` : An expression of a variable.\n",
    "- `6+i` : An expression of a constant plus a variable. \n",
    "- `exit(0)` : An expression of a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "As you’ve seen, an expression can contain symbols such as `+, *,` and `/`. In the C language, these symbols are called arithmetic operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `+` Addition\n",
    "- `-` Subtraction\n",
    "- `*` Multiplication\n",
    "- `/` Division\n",
    "- `%` Remainder (or modulus)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In the C language, a statement is a complete instruction, ending with a semicolon. In many cases, you can turn an expression into a statement by simply adding a semicolon at the end of the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`i = 1;`\n",
    "is a statement. You might have already figured out that the statement consists of an expression of `i = 1` and a semicolon `;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of statements can form a statement block that starts with an opening brace `{` and ends with a closing brace `}`.\n",
    "A statement block is treated as a single statement by the C compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`for(. . .) {\n",
    "    s3 = s1 + s2;\n",
    "    mul = s3 * c; \n",
    "    remainder = sum % c;\n",
    "}`\n",
    "\n",
    "is a statement block that starts with `{` and ends with `}`. Here `for` is a keyword in C that determines the statement block. ***The `for` keyword will be discussed later***\n",
    "\n",
    "- A statement block provides a way to group one or more statements together as a single statement. \n",
    "- Many C keywords can only control one statement. If you want to put more than one statement under the control of a C keyword, you can add those statements into a statement block so that the block is considered as one statement by the C keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a C Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are the building blocks of C programs.Remember you saw the `main()` function, as well as two C library functions, `printf()` and `exit()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s have a closer look at functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"../img/cfunction.png\"\n",

    "## Data Types and Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifier is the fancy term used to mean ***name***. In C, identifiers are used to refer to a number of things such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- the name of variables\n",
    "- the name of functions\n",
    "- the name of reserved keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "### C Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "The C language reserves certain words that have special meanings to the language. Those reserved words are sometimes called ***C keywords***. You should not use the C keywords for your own variable, constant, or function names in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "List of 32 reseved C Keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "- auto\n",

    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- A data type can be defined as a set of values with similar characteristics. All the values in a data type have the same properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Data types are used while defining a variable or functions in C***. It’s important for the compiler to understand the type of predefined data it is going to encounter in the program. This helps the compiler know which operations can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 Data types in C:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic\n",
    "- Derived\n",
    "- Void\n",
    "- Enumeration\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, for small programs, we use the basic fundamental data types in C – int, char, float, and double.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex and huge amounts of data, we use derived types – array, structure, union, and pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "These are also termed as primary or fundamental data types. All the names mean the same thing. Suppose we have to store student details like name, id, group, avg_marks, interest_on_fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use basic data types to store each of these data:\n",
    "\n",
    "`char name;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`int id;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`char group;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`float avg_marks;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`double interest;`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `char` Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "An object of the `char` data type represents a single character of the character set used by your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `A` is a character, and so is `a`. But `7` is a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a computer can only store numeric code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, characters such as `A`, `a`, `B`, `b`, and so on all have a unique numeric code that is used by computers to represent the characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, ***a character takes 8 bits (that is, 1 byte) to store its numeric code.***\n",
    "\n",
    "> A character has to have a unique numeric value in order to distinguish itself. Many computer systems support the ASCII character set, which contains a set of unique numeric values for up to 256 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declaring Character Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Declaring variables means creating variables and specifying their data types in a programming language before they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable that can represent different characters is called a character variable.\n",
    "You can set the data type of a variable to `char` by using the syntax below: \n",
    "\n",
    "`char variable_name;`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have more than one variable to declare, you can either use the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "`char variablename1;` \n",
    "\n",
    "`char variablename2;` \n",
    "\n",
    "`char variablename3;`\n",
    "\n",
    "or this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "`char variablename1, variablename2, variablename3;`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following statement declares `MyCharacter` and sets it to `A`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`char MyCharacter = ‘A’;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the following statements declare `x` and `y` as character variables and then assign values to them:\n",
    "\n",
    "`char x, y; `\n",
    "\n",
    "`x = ‘A’;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`y = ‘f’;`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Escape Character (\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "The escape character `\\` is used in the C language to tell the computer that a special character follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `int` Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the keyword `int` to represent integer data type in c. It is used to store non-fractional numbers which include positive, negative, and zero values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declaring Integer Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set the data type of a variable to `int` by using the syntax below: \n",
    "\n",
    "`int variablename;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the character declaration, if you have more than one variable to declare, you can either use the format like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`int variablename1;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`int variablename2;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`int variablename3;`\n",
    "\n",
    "or like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`int variablename1, variablename2, variablename3;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at the examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "`int MyInteger = 2314;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "`int A, a, B, b;` \n",
    "\n",
    "`A = 37;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`a = –37;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`B = -2418;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`b = 12 ;`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `float` Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Float data type allows a variable to store decimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A floating-point number is specified by the `float` keyword in the C language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declaring Floating-Point Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set the data type of a variable to `float` by using the syntax below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`float variablename;`\n",
    "                                         \n",
    "Similar to the character or integer declaration, if you have more than one variable to declare, you can either use the format like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`float variablename1;` \n",
    "\n",
    "`float variablename2;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`float variablename3;`\n",
    "\n",
    "or like the following one:\n",
    "\n",
    "`float variablename1, variablename2, variablename3;`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following statement declares myFloat as a float variable and assigns it a value:\n",
    "\n",
    "`float myFloat = 3.14;`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `double` Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Double data type is also same as float data type which allows up-to 10 digits after decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consumes more memory and it  is also slower as compared to `float`. So, it is advisable to use a smaller data type as much as possible for the sake of optimization of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `double` vs `float` comparison example\n",
    "\n",
    "`double average = 679999999.454;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`float score = 679999999.454;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`printf(\"average is %lf\", average);`\n",
    "\n",
    "`printf(\", score is %f\", score);`\n",
    "\n",

    "the average is 679999999.454000, the score is 680000000.000000\n",
    "\n",
