To understand this better, take the example of following through a recipe and preparing a dish. In that case, mixing all the ingredients and preparing the dish is ***processing***, whereas collecting all the ingredients in the right amount, performing all the pre-preparatory steps come under ***preprocessing***.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before the actual compilation of every C program it is passed through a ***Preprocessor***. \n",
    "- The ***Preprocessor*** is a part of the compiler which performs preliminary operations (conditionally compiling code, including files etc...) to your code before the compiler sees it.\n",
    "    - Think of the preprocessor as a helper that performs some initial modifications to your code before the actual compilation by the compiler.\n",
    "- The ***Preprocessor*** looks through the program trying to find out specific instructions called ***Preprocessor directives*** that it can understand. All Preprocessor directives begin with the `#` (hash) symbol. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Directives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directives are special instructions directed to the ***preprocessor*** on how it should process your source code.\n",
    "- Directives are handled by the preprocessor, which is either a separate program invoked by the compiler or part of the compiler itself.\n",

    "- They are used to introduce functions, data types, and other declarations into a C program. \n",
    "- When you include a header file in your C program using the `#include` directive, the contents of the header file are effectively copied and pasted into your program before compilation. This allows your program to access the declarations and definitions contained in the header file.\n",

    "## The `main( )` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very special function in C. Every C program must have a `main( )` function, and every C program can only have one `main( )` function.\n",

    "\n",
    "All functions in C can return values. (not all are required to return a value)\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `main()` function in C returns an integer value.\n",
    "- The return value of `main()` function shows how the program exited. The normal exit of program is represented by ***zero return value***. If the code has errors, fault etc., it will be terminated by ***non-zero value***.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB : In C the `main()` function can be left without adding a return value. By default, it will return zero/one depending on the program's exit status. ( ***meaning if you omit the return statement in the `main()` function, the compiler automatically adds a return 0; statement at the end, indicating a successful program termination. However, it is considered good practice to explicitly include a return statement to make the intent clear*** )\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `exit( )` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a C library function, `exit()`, that can be used to end a program. \n",
    "- The `exit()` function is defined in a header file, `stdlib.h`, so you have to include the header file at the beginning of your program in order to use the function. \n",
    "- The `exit()` function  does not return a value to your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So whats the difference between return and exit?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `return` statement is used within a function to terminate the execution of the function and return a value. It is used to indicate the end of the function's execution and provide a result\n",

    "- Then the source code file is compiled by a C compiler, which creates a new file. The new file is an ***object file***.\n",
    "    - You cannot execute the object file because there is some function code missing. You have to finish the next step which is linking.\n",
    "- Linking is the process of collecting and combining various pieces of code and data into a single file that can be loaded(copied) into memory and executed.\n",
    "    - It is done by invoking a special program called a linker, which normally comes with the compiler package.\n",

    "## Structure of a C Program\n",
    "\n",
    "As a building is made of bricks, a C program is made of basic elements, such as expressions, statements, statement blocks, and function blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by learning two smaller but important elements, ***constant and variable***, which make up expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name implies, a ***constant*** is a value that never changes.\n",
    "A ***variable***, on the other hand, can be used to present different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`i = 1;`\n",
    "\n",
    "where the symbol 1 is a constant because it always has the same value (1), and the symbol `i` is assigned the constant `1`. In other words, `i` contains the value of `1` after the statement is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, if there is another statement,\n",
    "\n",
    "`i = 10;`\n",
    "after it is executed, `i` is assigned the value of `10`. \n",
    "Because i can contain different values, it’s called a ***variable*** in the C language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of constants, variables, and operators that are used to denote computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(2 + 3) * 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "is an expression that adds 2 and 3 first, and then multiplies the result of the addition by 10. (The final result of the expression is 50.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other examples of expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `6` : An expression of a constant.\n",
    "- `i` : An expression of a variable.\n",
    "- `6+i` : An expression of a constant plus a variable. \n",
    "- `exit(0)` : An expression of a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "As you’ve seen, an expression can contain symbols such as `+, *,` and `/`. In the C language, these symbols are called arithmetic operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- + Addition\n",
    "- - Subtraction\n",
    "- * Multiplication\n",
    "- / Division\n",
    "- % Remainder (or modulus)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In the C language, a statement is a complete instruction, ending with a semicolon. In many cases, you can turn an expression into a statement by simply adding a semicolon at the end of the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`i = 1;`\n",
    "is a statement. You might have already figured out that the statement consists of an expression of `i = 1` and a semicolon `;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of statements can form a statement block that starts with an opening brace `{` and ends with a closing brace `}`.\n",
    "A statement block is treated as a single statement by the C compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`for(. . .) {\n",
    "    s3 = s1 + s2;\n",
    "    mul = s3 * c; \n",
    "    remainder = sum % c;\n",
    "}`\n",
    "\n",
    "is a statement block that starts with `{` and ends with `}`. Here `for` is a keyword in C that determines the statement block. ***The `for` keyword will be discussed later***\n",
    "\n",
    "- A statement block provides a way to group one or more statements together as a single statement. \n",
    "- Many C keywords can only control one statement. If you want to put more than one statement under the control of a C keyword, you can add those statements into a statement block so that the block is considered as one statement by the C keyword.\n",
    "\n",
