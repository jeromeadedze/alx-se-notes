    "### The `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the while keyword is to repeatedly execute a statement over and over while a given condition is true. When the condition of the while loop is no longer logi- cally true, the loop terminates and program execution resumes at the next statement fol- lowing the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of the while statement is \n",
    "\n",
    "`while (expression)\n",
    "     statement;`\n",
    "\n",
    "***NB: the braces `{` and `}` are discarded because the `while` statement only contains one statement.***\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`while (expression) { \n",
    "    statement1; \n",
    "    statement2;\n",
    "    . . .\n",
    "}`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here expression is the condition of the while statement. This expression is evaluated first. If the expression evaluates to a nonzero value, then statement is executed. After that, expression is evaluated once again. The statement is then executed one more time if the expression still evaluates to a nonzero value. This process is repeated over and over until expression evaluates to zero, or logical false.\n",

    "### The `do` - `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`do`-`while` puts the expression at the bottom of the loop. In this way, the statements in the loop are guaranteed to be executed ***at least once before the expression is tested.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form for the `do`-`while` statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`do {\n",
    "statement1;\n",
    "statement2;\n",
    "...\n",
    "} while (expression);`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the statements inside the statement block are executed once, and then expression is evaluated in order to determine whether the looping is to continue. If the expression evaluates to a nonzero value, the do-while loop continues; otherwise, the looping stops and execution proceeds to the next statement following the loop.\n",

    "***NB : with do-while statement, the `while` statement ends with a semicolon, which is an important distinction from the `while` statements and `if` statement.***\n",

    "    statement;`\n",

    "\n",
    "### the `Null` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` statement does not end with a semicolon. The `for` statement has within it either a statement block that ends with the closing brace `}`, or a single statement that ends with a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A null statement contains nothing but a semicolon. In other words, a null statement is a statement with no expression.\n",
    "It is a statement that does nothing when executed. It is denoted by a semicolon `;` with no actual code following it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the purpose of null statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "- do nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop needs at least one statement.  If we have no valid statement to add then we can put null statement below as shown with its syntax:\n",

    "Example 1:\n",

    "### Nested Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put a loop (***an inner loop***) inside another one (***an outer loop***) to make ***nested loops.*** When the program reaches an inner loop, it will run just like any other statement inside the outer loop.\n",
