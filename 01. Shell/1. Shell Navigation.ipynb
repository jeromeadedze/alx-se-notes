    "Computers these days have a variety of interfaces for user interaction; fanciful graphical user interfaces, voice interfaces, and even AR/VR are everywhere. These are great for 80% of use-cases, but they are often fundamentally restricted in what they allow you to do — you cannot press a button that isn’t there or give a voice command that hasn’t been programmed. To take full advantage of the tools your computer provides, we have to go old-school and drop down to a textual interface: ***The Shell***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shell is one example of Command Line Interfaces (CLIs). \n",
    "\n",
    "> A ***command line interface*** (CLI) is a computer program that runs on text-based inputs to execute different tasks. Instead of pointing and clicking with a mouse, it receives single-line commands that interact with system elements like file management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the earliest days of computers, the CLIs were the only User Interfaces that were available to operating systems (UNIX-based Systems such as Linux etc.) \n",
    "- But now we also have Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) alongside the Command Line Interfaces (CLIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "On most Operating Systems,***The most popular shell program used is called the BASH (Bourne Again Shell), which is an enhanced/improved version of the original version of the UNIX Shell program, sh.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "***BASH*** is not the only shell that is available for Operating systems, some others include; Zsh (Z Shell), Ksh(Korn SHell), Csh (C SHell),etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Mac Operating System Terminal uses BASH(by default), Windows Operating System Terminal use PowerShell(by default)\n",
    "\n",
    "> PowerShell replaced the Command Prompt as the default in the Windows 10 operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "> NB: ***You can install different shell programs on your operating system. Shells are software programs, and depending on your operating system, you have the flexibility to install and use different shell programs of your choice.***"

    "1. `pwd` : shows where you currently are in your computer system.\n",
    "2. `ls (options -a , -l)` : lists all the directories and files that is in your present file path/location on the computer system.\n",
    "3. `mkdir` : create a directory/folder\n",
    "4. `cd`: used to move from one directory to another\n",
    "5. `clear`: clears all returned outputs from command line\n",
    "6. `touch file_name` : creates a file\n",
    "7. `nano \"file_name\"` : edits file in nana text editor, we use`ctrl + 0` to save edit\n",
    "8. `cat \"file_name\"`- to see content of a file\n",
    "9. `less \"file_name\"` : to see content of lengthy files (press q to exit)\n",
    "10. `mv \"filename\"  \"new_directory\"`: move a file to a directory or a directory to another directory.\n",
    "11. `cp \"org_file\" \"directory_name\"`:  copies a file from its present directory to another directory.\n",
    "12. `rm \"file_name\"` : delete a file\n",
    "13. `rmdir \"directory_name\"` : delete an empty directory\n",
    "14. `rm -R \"directory_name\"` : delete a directory with files\"\n",
    "15. `which \"file_name\" : gives exact location of a file\n",
    "16. `history` : gives you a list of commands used\n",
    "17. `echo \"some_text\"`: prints text on screen\n",
    "18. `whoami`: prints out current user\n",

    "\n",
    "- ***An executable program*** : a file that contains instructions that can be executed by the operating system's shell or command-line interpreter. It is usually a text file that contains a series of shell commands or a script written in a scripting language like Bash. These programs can perform various tasks, such as file manipulation, system administration, data processing, and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***A command built into the shell itself*** : bash provides a number of commands internally called ***shell builtins(a command or function that is part of the shell itself.)***. The `cd` command, for example, is a shell builtin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***A shell function*** : It is a sequence of commands that do a single job. Typically, a function is used for an operation that you tend to do frequently \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***An alias*** : Commands that we can define ourselves, built from other commands. A shell alias is a shortcut to reference a command. It can be used to avoid typing long commands. For common patterns it can reduce keystrokes and improve efficiency. A simple example is setting default options on commands to avoid having to type them each time a command is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- `type` : used to find out how a command that you enter will be interpreted – as a built-in command, external command, or an alias\n",
    "\n",
    "- `which` : shows the full path of (shell) commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: which only works for executable programs, not builtins nor aliases that are substitutes for actual executable programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `help` : The help command is the simplest way to get information regarding a built-in shell command. It helps you fetch information from the shell’s internal documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `man` : It is used to display the user manual of any command that we can run on the terminal. It provides a detailed view of the command which includes NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUES, ERRORS, FILES, VERSIONS, EXAMPLES, AUTHORS and SEE ALSO."

    "### Shell Expansion \n",
    "\n",
    "When a shell command is called, it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splits into Tokens\n",
    "    - Tokens refer to the individual units or components into which a command or statement is divided.\n",
    "    - Tokens are used to identify different elements of a command, such as the command itself, options, arguments, and other parameters.(These components are usually separated by whitespaces or specific characters)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Each token is expanded, then quotes are removed\n",
    "    - Expansion involves interpreting and modifying the tokens based on certain rules and mechanisms. There are several types of expansions that can occur, such as ****variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and pathname expansion (globbing).*** During expansion, quotes (single or double) around tokens are also removed, and the resulting values are substituted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The command is then interpreted.\n",
    "    - It identifies the command to be executed, along with its arguments and options, based on the expanded tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brace Expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Brace expansion is the first shell expansion operation that occurs ***(if present)***, it expands a simple expression that represents a sequence or range of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `file{1..5}` into `file1 file2 file3 file4 file5` \n",
    "- `file{A,B,C}` into `fileA fileB fileC`\n",
    "- `echo sp{el,il,al}l` gives `spell spill spall`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tilde Expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tilde character `~` has a special meaning. When used at the beginning of a word, it expands into the name of the ***home directory of the named user***, or if no user is named, the home directory of the current user:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `~username/file` expands to `/home/username/file`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter Expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A ***parameter*** is an entity that stores values. It can be a name, a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A ***variable*** is a parameter denoted by a name.  They are places where the system, the shell, or shell users like ourselves can store data(such as any number, string value, list of values (numeric)).\n",

    "- When assigning a variable, its name must be comprised solely of ***alphanumeric and underscore characters***, and it may not begin with a numeral. There may be no spaces around the equal sign; the name must immediately precede it and the value immediately follow\n",
    "- If value is not given, the variable is assigned the null string. All values undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal.\n",
    "- It is a good habit to quote content strings when assigning values to variables: this will reduce the chance that you make errors.\n",
    "    - It helps preserve whitespace, etc\n",
    "- In Bash, the `unset` command is used to unset or remove the value of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a variable in the shell, we use the `$` dollar symbol and specify the variable name:\n",
    "\n",
    "`name=\"Selorm\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo \"Your name is: $name`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Your name is: Selorm`\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: \n",
    "- By convention, if a variable is in uppercase then it is an environment variable or a built in variable that comes from the shell. An environment variable is a variable that is set by the system. They often contain useful values to help configure your system. Few examples are `$SHELL`, `$USER`, `$HOME`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables that you define yourself should be lowercase. This helps to distinguish between environment variables and your own variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "When the dollar symbol  ` $ ` is used, this indicates that the shell is going to perform ***parameter expansion*** , which expands variables or the parameters of a script. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It can also be used to indicate command substitution or arithmetic expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with parameter expansion the value of a shell variable can be read, expanded, replaced, or modified based on the particular syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "` $ { variable } `\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply replaces the name of a variable or parameter with its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: When using parameter expansion it is generally preferable to surround the name of the parameter/variable with ***braces `{}`*** - this allows you to tell the shell clearly what the name of the parameter/variable is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`fruit=apples`\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo \"I like ${fruit}`\n",

    "\n",
    "`[INPUT] echo $(ls)`\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To create, update, and delete shell variables, you can use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable, use the syntax variable_name=value. No spaces are allowed around the equal sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "`name=\"John\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the value of an existing variable, simply assign a new value to it using the same syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "`name=\"Jane\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deleting Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a variable, you can use the unset command followed by the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "`unset name`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of variables\n",

    "- ***Local variables*** are only accessible within the section of code in which they are declared. For example, if we declare a variable inside our Bash script, it will not be accessible outside of that script.\n",
    "    - Variables which are specific to the current instance of shell. They are basically used within the shell, but not available for the program or other shells that are started from within the current shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Global variables*** are also called as environment variables(global variable) are special built-in variables in kernel of Linux operating system for each shell. These variables are defined in Capital Letters. `printenv` command is used to display all the environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also divide them in categories according to the content the variable contains. In this respect, variables come in 4 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- String variables\n",
    "- Integer variables\n",
    "- Constant variables\n",
    "- Array variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exporting variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bash export variable is a variable that is made available to all child processes of current shell. When a variable is exported, it becomes an environment variable, which means it can be accessed by any program or script that runs in current shell environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exporting a variable in Bash is straightforward. To export a variable, you need to use `export` command followed by name of variable you want to export.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`export samp_variable`\n",
    "\n",
    "The export command can also export bash functions in addition to bash variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `export -f` command-line option to export functions so that they’re also available in child shells and processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Export also provides a command-line option `-n` to remove a variable from export:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reserved variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Reserved variables are special variables that have predefined meanings or behavior in the shell. These variables are reserved by the shell and serve specific purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `$HOME` : The home directory of the current user.\n",
    "- `$PATH` : an environment variable that contains an ordered list of paths that Linux will search for executables when running a command.\n",
    "- `$OLDPWD` : The previous working directory as set by the cd built-in.\n",
    "- `PS1`: is a primary prompt variable which holds `\\u@\\h \\W\\\\$ ` special bash characters. This is the default structure of the bash prompt and is displayed every time a user logs in using a terminal. These default values are set in the `/etc/bashrc` file.\n",
    "    - `\\u` is a special character sequence that expands to the username of the current user.\n",
    "    - `\\@` is a special character sequence that expands to the current time in 12-hour format.\n",
    "    - `\\h` is a special character sequence that expands to the hostname of the machine.\n",
    "    - `\\W` is a special character sequence that expands to the current working directory (only the last component of the path).\n",
    "    - `\\\\$` is a special character sequence that expands to a dollar sign `($)` for a regular user or a hash symbol `(#)` for the root user.\n",
    "    - ***Altogether, the default PS1 structure would display something like: `username@hostname current_directory$` in the terminal.***\n",
    "    - ***This is simply explaining that the default structure of the Bash prompt, which includes username, hostname, current working directory, and a symbol indicating the user's privileges, is set in the /etc/bashrc file. This structure is displayed every time a user logs in using a terminal unless it is modified by the user in their own shell initialization file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile).***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Special parameters are variables with predefined meanings or functionality in the shell. They provide access to information or features related to the shell's behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `$0` : The filename of the current script.\n",
    "- `$?` : The exit status of the ***last executed command***. A value of 0 typically indicates success, while non-zero values represent various failure conditions.`$?` is often used in shell scripting to determine the success or failure of previous commands and to make decisions based on the exit status.\n",
    "- `$!` : The process ID (PID) of the last executed background command or job.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single and Double Quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Quotes `' '`:\n",
    "\n",
    "When enclosed in single quotes, everything is treated as a literal string. No variable substitution or command substitution takes place.\n",
    "Special characters within single quotes lose their special meanings and are treated as literal characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "echo `'Hello $name'` will output: `Hello $name`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Double Quotes `\" \"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Double quotes allow for variable substitution and command substitution. Variables enclosed in double quotes are expanded to their values, and command substitutions are executed.\n",
    "Special characters within double quotes retain their special meanings and are interpreted by the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "`echo \"Hello $name\"` will output: `Hello John`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proper Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use single quotes when you want to preserve the literal string and disable variable or command substitution.\n",
    "- Use double quotes when you want variable or command substitution to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command Substitution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `$()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `$()` syntax is the recommended and modern way to perform command substitution.\n",
    "Enclose a command within `$()` to substitute its output as part of the command or assignment.\n",

    "UNIX is an operating system(suite of programs which make the computer work)\n",
    "It is considered as the mother of most of the operating systems.\n",
    "Types are: \n",
    "- GNU/Linux,\n",
    "- MacOS X\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX OS is made up of parts;\n",
    "- The kernel: The kernel of UNIX is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls.\n",
    "- The shell: The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt (% on our systems).\n",

    "- The master control program of Unix is its ***Kernel***. The kernel has full control over the entire system. It has subsystems that offer services to file system handling, resource handling, memory management, start & stop programs, and a few other low-level core tasks. (Think of it as the brain of your machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Shell*** is the interface between the user and the kernel. Shell and the user type in the commands, interpret these commands, and call the computer programs accordingly.  (Think of it as a human interpreter)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The shell and kernel are two fundamental components of an operating system\n",

    "Linux is not Unix, but it is a Unix-like operating system. Linux system is derived from Unix and it is a continuation of the basis of Unix design."
